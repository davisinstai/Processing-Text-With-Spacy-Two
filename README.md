## Project Description

The goals of this assignment are:
* To review basic NLP tasks for words using dictionaries, sets, lists and file read/write.

Here are the steps you should do to successfully complete this project:
1. From moodle, accept the assignment. Open and set up a code space (install a python kernal and select it).
2. Complete the notebook and commit it to Github. Make sure to answer all questions, and to commit the notebook in a "run" state!
3. I wrote the comments; you write the code! Complete spacy-on-files.py. Run it on the command line using % `python spacy-on-nlp.py`. Run it once using `c*.txt` as the file pattern and once using `files.zip` as the file pattern. For the latter case, use `ark:__27927_phznswfkrxz` as the document you want analyses for. Commit the `doc`, `table` and `statistics` for each of those documents.
4. Edit the README.md file. Provide your name, your class year, links to/descriptions of any extensions and a list of resources. 
5. Commit your code often. We will take the last commit before the deadline as your submission of the project.

For extra credit:
* Read the spaCy docs (https://spacy.io/usage/models). Figure out how to make spaCy work for another language. Add a starter question asking the user to indicate the language. 
* We are doing all of this on the command line. If you got mercury web apps running, make some of this work in mercury.
* Take a look at the [spaCy universe pdf reader](https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacypdfreader/). Download the pdfs for at least two of the papers in our corpus and load them using this reader. Does this reader give cleaner text then constellate, or not? Justify your answer.
* Look closely at the documents in `files.zip`. Which of the contents are not really part of the text? How might you remove those contents using techniques we learn in class?
* Your other ideas are welcome! If you'd like to discuss one with Dr Stent, feel free.
