    "Here are the steps you should do to successfully complete this project:\n",
    "1. From moodle, accept the assignment.\n",
    "2. Open and set up a code space (install a python kernal and select it).\n",
    "3. Complete the notebook and commit it to Github. Make sure to answer all questions, and to commit the notebook in a \"run\" state!\n",
    "4. Edit the README.md file. Provide your name, your class year, links to/descriptions of any extensions and a list of resources. Make sure to paste the output from running spacy-on-files.py!\n",
    "5. Commit your code often. We will take the last commit before the deadline as your submission of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For extra credit:\n",
    "* Read the spaCy docs (https://spacy.io/usage/models). Figure out how to make spaCy work for another language. Add a starter question asking the user to indicate the language. \n",
    "* We are doing all of this on the command line. If you got mercury web apps running, make some of this work in mercury.\n",
    "* Take a look at the [spaCy universe pdf reader](https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacypdfreader/). Download the pdfs for at least two of the papers in our corpus and load them using this reader. Does this reader give cleaner text then constellate, or not? Justify your answer.\n",
    "* Your other ideas are welcome! If you'd like to discuss one with Dr Stent, feel free."
